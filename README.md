# Stream match detector

This project is an Apache Flink application written in Scala that processes streaming data from Kafka
to detect events based on incoming messages. It uses Flinkâ€™s keyed process functions and 
the complex event processing (CEP) library to identify and output match events.

It receives a stream of Messages via kafka as a String with the format:
```
<USER_ID>,[start|end],<EXPERIENCE>,<TIMESTAMP>
```

They represent if a specific user started or ended a gaming session and the current experience.

The application task is to generate an event when the user id generates a matching pair i.e.
```
123, start, 0, 1 # User 123 started a gaming session with 0 experience at timestamp 1
123, end, 5, 2   # User 123 ended a gaming session with 5 experience at timestamp 2
```

Generates a MatchEvent
```
123, 5  # User 123 won 5 experience
```

## Run in a local cluster


```shell
# Go to the flinkcluster directory.
cd flinkcluster
# start the flinkcluster docker compose.
docker compose up -d
# wait until flink cluster is up and running
# check at http://localhost:8081/
# create the test kafka topic
./kafkaCreateTopic.sh
# submit the jar flink app into the cluster
./submit.sh
# start generating events
./kakfaWriter.sh
# Check the logs for inspecting the generated events
docker logs flink-taskmanager-a
docker logs flink-taskmanager-b
```
